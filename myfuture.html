        <h3 class="line-title">While Studying</h3>
        <small class="text-muted"><p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">I believe I will study computer science diligently until I graduate, 
          while balancing my studies and my personal life. 
          I will study hard, but I will not neglect my life outside of the univercity.
          I will have friends, a social life, and opportunities to experience new things. 
          I believe I can achieve a good balance between studying and living. 
          I will strive to complete my degree within four years, making the most of every experience the university offers. 
          I will also look for opportunities to work after graduating from computer science.
        </small>

        <h3 class="line-title">After Graduation</h3>
        <small class="text-muted"><p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">I think that if I can graduate in computer science, 
          after completing my bachelor's degree, I will work in the field of computer science for at least two years. 
          If I see that the work I am doing has potential for growth in the future and I truly enjoy this field, 
          I believe I will pursue a master's degree in computer science to benefit my career. However, 
          if after graduating and working for two years I do not see any opportunities for advancement in this profession or I do not enjoy this line of work, 
          I may start a new bachelor's degree to change my career path.
